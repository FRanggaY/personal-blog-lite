Step by Step

<br />

## Firewall

A firewall is the first tool you should use to limit access to your server.

Install the firewall

<CodeBlock children={`sudo apt install ufw`}/>

Activate the firewall

<CodeBlock children={`sudo ufw enable`}/>

1. Allow SSH connections

<CodeBlock children={`sudo ufw allow ssh`}/>

2. If your server is used for web services

<CodeBlock children={`
  sudo ufw allow http
  sudo ufw allow https
`}/>

3. Add other rules as necessary. For example, if you're using Docker, ensure the ports used by your containers are allowed if needed.

<br />

## Fail2ban

Fail2ban is a tool that helps block IP addresses that attempt brute-force or repeated attacks on your server.

Install Fail2ban:

<CodeBlock children={` sudo apt install fail2ban`}/>

Configure Fail2ban to protect SSH and Nginx:

<CodeBlock children={` sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local`}/>

Add the configuration for SSH and Nginx:

<CodeBlock children={`
  [sshd]
  enabled = true
  port = ssh
  maxretry = 3
  findtime = 600
  bantime = 3600

  [nginx-http-auth]
  enabled = true
  port = http,https
  filter = nginx-http-auth
  logpath = /var/log/nginx/error.log
  maxretry = 3
  findtime = 600
  bantime = 3600
`}/>

[nginx-http-auth]: This section configures Fail2ban to protect Nginx (web server) from brute-force attacks on HTTP authentication.

enabled = true: Enable Fail2ban protection for Nginx.

port = http, https: Sets Fail2ban to monitor HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports.

filter = nginx-http-auth: Uses a filter appropriate for HTTP authentication in Nginx to detect failed login attempts.

logpath = /var/log/nginx/error.log: The log file where Fail2ban will monitor failed login attempts (in this case, Nginx’s error.log).

maxretry = 3: Fail2ban will block an IP after 3 failed authentication attempts within the time window.

findtime = 600: 10 minutes for checking consecutive authentication failures.

bantime = 3600: After 3 failed authentication attempts within 10 minutes, the IP address will be blocked for 1 hour.

<br />

[sshd]: This section configures Fail2ban to protect the SSH service (used for logging into the server).

enabled = true: This means Fail2ban is enabled to monitor SSH.

port = ssh: Sets Fail2ban to monitor the default SSH port (usually port 22).

maxretry = 3: Fail2ban will block an IP address after 3 consecutive failed login attempts.

findtime = 600: Time window for the failed login attempts. This is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

bantime = 3600: After 3 failed login attempts in 10 minutes, the IP address will be blocked for 1 hour (3600 seconds).

## Use SSL/TLS for Encryption
If your server is serving websites, make sure you use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt the data sent between the client and server. Let's Encrypt is an easy and free way to obtain an SSL certificate.

Steps to enable SSL/TLS with Nginx using Let's Encrypt: Install Certbot and the Nginx plugin:

<CodeBlock children={` sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx`}/>

Run Certbot to obtain an SSL certificate: Certbot will automatically configure Nginx and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

<br />
Regular Updates and Patching
Keeping your system up-to-date with security patches is crucial. You can set up automatic updates for your system or installed applications. For automatic updates on an Ubuntu system:

<CodeBlock children={` sudo apt install unattended-upgrades`}/>

Configure automatic updates in the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades.

<br />
Limit Access with SSH Key Authentication
Using SSH keys is more secure than using a password to log in to the server.

Here are the steps to disable password-based login and only allow SSH key authentication:

1. Create an SSH key on your local machine:
<CodeBlock children={` ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`}/>

When running ssh-keygen, you will be asked to enter a location to save the generated key. If you don’t specify a file location, it will use the default ~/.ssh/id_rsa for the private key and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub for the public key. You will also be prompted to enter a passphrase (optional). This passphrase adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to enter it each time you use the private key.

2. On the Server (Copying the Public Key)
Copy the public key to the server:

<CodeBlock children={` ssh-copy-id user@your_server_ip`}/>

If ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually add the public key content to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server:

<CodeBlock children={` cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@your_server_ip "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"`}/>

3. Edit the SSH Configuration to Disable Password Authentication:
<CodeBlock children={` sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`}/>

Ensure the following values:

<CodeBlock children={` PasswordAuthentication no PubkeyAuthentication yes`}/>

If it doesn’t work, edit UsePAM no.

4. Restart the SSH Service:
<CodeBlock children={` sudo systemctl restart sshd`}/>

If you have set a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter it.

By following these steps, you’ve configured SSH authentication using public/private key pairs, which not only strengthens security but also makes logging in easier without needing to enter a password every time.
