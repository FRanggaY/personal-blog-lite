# This project is no longer maintained due to the following issues:

- Large file size for a relatively small project

- Dependencies on other projects, making it harder to maintain (a small project should require minimal effort)

- Originally intended as a personal tool, but it includes a management system â€” leading to a misleading focus

# The decision has been made to:

- Migrate to a framework with a lightweight file size

- Keep it simple as an MVP (minimal viable product), focused on small-scale and personal use

# However, the project will still prioritize:

- Easy maintenance

- Easy customization

# Progress 

- Successfully changed the framework and reduced the project file size from 690 MB to 77 MB
